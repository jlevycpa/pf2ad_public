# PF2AD

The authoritative "database" of employee contact information is maintained by HR in an Exchange public folder
called W&G Employees. The contacts in this folder contain the correct job title and mobile/home phone numbers
for each employee according to HR. This program syncs those attributes to Active Directory, which feeds several
systems such as the Outlook GAL, Sharepoint, and Skype for Business.

This program can be executed manually by calling PF2AD.main(nil) or scheduled as a periodic cron job.
